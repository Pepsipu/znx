`znx` allows the user to perform the following:

- Make parallel deployments of bootable ISO images (Linux-based distributions are expected).
- Upgrade the systems in an safe (atomic) way.
- Update the images based on differential content.

For more information about how `znx` works, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/Nitrux/znx/wiki)
